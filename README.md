# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Hidden Markov Model

 # Overview
 This project implements a multi-layered system designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions by combining Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) Clustering and Neural Networks. The system aims to identify suspicious spending behaviors while significantly reducing the rate of false alarms.

# 🧠 How It Works
The detection process is executed in three distinct phases:

**Authentication:** Initial verification of card details and user identity.

**Behavioral Analysis:** Uses Fuzzy C-Means Clustering to find normal usage patterns based on past activity. A "suspicion score" is calculated based on how much a transaction deviates from these patterns.

**Learning Phase:** Suspicious transactions are passed to a Neural Network to determine if they are truly fraudulent or just an occasional deviation by a genuine user.

# 🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: 

**Python Framework:** Django (for web integration) 

**Database:** MySQL 

**Design:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

**Environment:** MATLAB-2014 (used for core simulation and results) 

## 🚀 How to Run (Step-by-Step guide)
To get this project running on your own computer, follow these four simple steps:

**1. Prepare the Database**
* This project uses MySQL to store and manage transaction data.

* Open your MySQL tool (like XAMPP, WAMP, or MySQL Workbench).

* Create a new database named `fraud_detection`.

 If you have a `.sql` file in your project, import it into this new database.

**2. Install the Dependencies**
You need to install the Python libraries listed in your requirements.txt file so the code can "talk" to the database and run the math models. Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**3. Start the Web Server**
This project uses Django to create the website interface. To start it up, type this in your terminal:

`python manage.py runserver`

**4. View the Project**
Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.) and go to this address:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is too large for GitHub. You can download it here:

 **Phase 1:** Secure Authentication
The system begins with a secure login to verify the cardholder's identity.

**Phase 2:** Transaction Monitoring
Every transaction is passed through the Fuzzy C-Means logic to check for behavioral deviations.

**Phase 3:** Fraud Detection Results
When a transaction exceeds the "Suspicion Score," the Neural Network flags it.

## 📊 Results & Performance
The system was evaluated based on its ability to distinguish between genuine transactions and fraudulent ones.

### Accuracy and Metrics
* **Overall Accuracy:** 93.90%
* **FCM Clustering:** Successfully categorized users into spending profiles.
* **Neural Network:** Minimized false alarms by learning from suspicious deviations.
